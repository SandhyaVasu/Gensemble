Welcome to GENSEMBLE — the Genome Assembly Game!! Happy learning!

The only dependencies are:
-> Python
-> Pygame, which can be installed by pip install pygame
-> The folder — Final_game_codes has the Python script: game.py, which can be run directly. Kindly ensure that the sound files (.wav files) are kept in the same folder as the game.py file.
